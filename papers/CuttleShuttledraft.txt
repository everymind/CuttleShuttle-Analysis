The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, has long been admired and studied in large part due to its remarkable repertoire of color patterns [citations from introduction of 1987 Adaptive Coloration in Young Cuttlefish RTHanlon and JBMessenger]. The hunting behaviour of Sepia officinalis when attacking prawns was first described in great written detail by JB Messenger in 1968, who emphasized that cuttlefish are primarily visual (they don't react to the smell of prey) and whose descriptions focused on whole body movements and tentacle dynamics. To this day this paper remains the best written documentation of the sequence of behaviours made by cuttlefish while hunting, its the one that is referenced in all papers that wish to refer to the hunting sequence in Sepia officinalis. 

Since then, there have been many descriptions of cuttlefish body pattern during prey capture comparing differences in body pattern expression based on prey type [REFS], background substrate (i.e. sand, pebbles, etc) [REFS], age/developmental stage of cuttlefish [REFS], and whether the animal was moving or stationary while making prey capture [REFS]. However these studies do not publish videos of the prey capture sequence to update Messenger's early written descriptions, and none attempt to quantify the changes in chromatophore expression during the phases of hunting. This study does both, and is also the first attempt to systematically study a post-attack body pattern often observed in the field [REF: Roger Hanlon's Camouflage and Signaling sequences associated with Prey Capture diagram]. Currently, only one pre-print [REF: Cooke, 2019] makes any mention of this post-attack body pattern, which they refer to as a "pursuit-deterrent" signal.
