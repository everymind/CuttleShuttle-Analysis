The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, has long been admired and studied in large part due to its remarkable repertoire of color patterns [citations from introduction of 1987 Adaptive Coloration in Young Cuttlefish RTHanlon and JBMessenger]. The hunting behaviour of Sepia officinalis when attacking prawns was first described in great written detail by JB Messenger in 1968, who emphasized that cuttlefish are primarily visual (they don't react to the smell of prey) and whose descriptions focused on whole body movements and tentacle dynamics. To this day this paper remains the best written documentation of the sequence of behaviours made by cuttlefish while hunting, its the one that is referenced in all papers that wish to refer to the hunting sequence in Sepia officinalis. 

Since then, there have been many descriptions of cuttlefish body pattern during prey capture comparing differences in body pattern expression based on prey type [REFS], background substrate (i.e. sand, pebbles, etc) [REFS], age/developmental stage of cuttlefish [REFS], and whether the animal was moving or stationary while making prey capture [REFS]. However these studies do not publish videos of the prey capture sequence to update Messenger's early written descriptions, and none attempt to quantify the changes in chromatophore expression during the phases of hunting. This study does both, and is also the first attempt to systematically study a post-attack body pattern often observed in the field [REF: Roger Hanlon's Camouflage and Signaling sequences associated with Prey Capture diagram] and only recently mentioned in a pre-print [REF: Cooke, 2019], in which the paper authers refer to a possible "pursuit-deterrent" signal observed in field video recordings of cuttlefish. 

# Methods
This experiment was conducted via a collaboration with Roger Hanlon and the Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole, USA, who kindly provided the experimental animals and trained me in the basics of captive cuttlefish care/husbandry. The behaviour paradigm was based on a paradigm used by the Kampff Lab with rodents [REF: Goncalo's paper], modified to accommodate the constraints of working with the animals at the MBL. In this study we trained cuttlefish (N=6, age=15 months, sex unknown) to hunt "robotic prey", which initially mimicked the movement patterns of prawn, one of Sepia officinalis' natural prey. As the study progressed the "robotic prey" moved in increasingly unnatural patterns. 

Animals were housed in partitioned home tubs. Need details of home tubs? Water was filtered sea water from the harbor just outside the Marine Biological Lab. 

Experimental tank was a rectangular box with an open top and transparent walls ("Cuttle Shuttle Box", NEED DIMENSIONS) placed within a larger circular tank (NEED DIMENSIONS) fitted with equipment to maintain a steady flow of fresh seawater into the experimental arena. The larger circular tank was lined with waterproof LED strip lighting in order to provide uniform, multidirectional luminance in the experimental arena. Small plastic tubes moved water into and out of the Cuttle Shuttle Box; the water flow was kept minimal in order to reduce surface perturbations, which would have interfered with the overhead filming. 




# Results

We confirm Messenger's original written ethogram of Sepia officinalis' hunting behaviour and supplement the wealth of written description in the literature with high speed videos of hunting cuttlefish, filmed from above in order to prioritize views of changes to body pattern on the cuttlefish mantle during hunting. We also present the first detailed laboratory study and quantitative analysis of the unique post-attack body pattern observed by many in the wild.
